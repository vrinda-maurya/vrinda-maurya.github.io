        <p class="paragraph">Marine life, sea life, or ocean life is the plants, animals and other organisms that live
            in the salt water of seas or oceans, or the brackish water of coastal estuaries. At a fundamental level,
            marine life affects the nature of the planet. Marine organisms, mostly microorganisms, produce oxygen and
            sequester carbon. Marine life in part shape and protect shorelines, and some marine organisms even help
            create new land (e.g. coral building reefs).

            Most life forms evolved initially in marine habitats. By volume, oceans provide about 90% of the living
            space on the planet.[2] The earliest vertebrates appeared in the form of fish,[3] which live exclusively in
            water. Some of these evolved into amphibians, which spend portions of their lives in water and portions on
            land. One group of amphibians evolved into reptiles and mammals and a few subsets of each returned to the
            ocean as sea snakes, sea turtles, seals, manatees, and whales. Plant forms such as kelp and other algae grow
            in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. Plankton forms the general foundation of the
            ocean food chain, particularly phytoplankton which are key primary producers.

            Marine invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters, including
            breathing tubes as in mollusc siphons. Fish have gills instead of lungs, although some species of fish, such
            as the lungfish, have both. Marine mammals ( e.g. dolphins, whales, otters, and seals) need to surface
            periodically to breathe air.
