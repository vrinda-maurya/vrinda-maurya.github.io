                Like forests, wildlife consisting of animals, birds, insects, etc. living in the forest is a national
                resource, which not only helps in maintaining the ecological balance but is also beneficial for various
                economic activities that generate revenue from tourism. The rich flora and fauna also play a major role
                in maintaining the ecological balance of a region. There was a time when human needs were minimal and
                there was bare interference in the wildlife. There is no denying the fact that due to urbanization,
                pollution, and human interventions wildlife is rapidly disappearing from the planet.


                Today the biodiversity of the world is threatened due to the extinction of species. There are
                thirty-five hotspots around the world, which supports 43% of birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians as
                endemic. The IUCN has compiled a list of species and has classified the different species under extinct,
                critically endangered, less endangered, vulnerable, near threatened, and least concerned. This list is
                called the Red Data Book. According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the number of birds, animals,
                marine and freshwater creatures has dropped by almost one-third of its earlier population.

                <aside>In order to preserve the world, we need to focus on the conservation of the flora and fauna of
                     world. With the loss of trees and by deforestation, there has been an immense loss of natural
                    habitat of the wild animals. Many of the species are standing on the verge of being extinct. Poaching and
                    hunting of the wild animals have also led to the destruction. Hence, we need to understand the need of the
                    hour
                    to preserve wildlife and act accordingly. In order to conserve them, several steps can be taken both
                    by
                    the government and by the people of the world. Wildlife prevention and conservation acts should be
                    implemented strictly by the government. People should stop using the materials made by wild animals.
                    This would decrease their hunting. Environmental education should be a compulsory subject to be
                    taught
                    in the schools and the colleges to make the upcoming generation very well unknown with the fact.
